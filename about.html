<h1><center><mark>Do you wanna know what is Corn</mark></center></h1>
<h4> corn, (Zea mays), also called Indian corn or maize, cereal plant of the grass family (Poaceae) and its edible grain. 
The domesticated crop originated in the Americas and is one of the most widely distributed of the world’s food crops.
Corn is used as livestock feed, as human food, as biofuel, and as raw material in industry.</h4>
<h1><center><mark>Domestication and history</mark></center></h1>
<h4>Corn was first domesticated by native peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. 
Modern corn is believed to have been derived from the Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), a wild grass. Its culture had spread as far north as southern Maine by the time of European settlement of North America, and Native Americans taught European colonists to grow the indigenous grains. 
Since its introduction into Europe by Christopher Columbus and other explorers and colonizers, corn has spread to all areas of the world suitable to its cultivation. It is grown from 58° N latitude in Canada and Russia to 40° S latitude in South America, with a corn crop maturing somewhere in the world nearly every month of the year.
It is the most important crop in the United States and is a staple food in many places.</h4>
<h1><center><mark>What type of food is corn?</mark></center></h1>
<h4>According to the USDA, corn can be either a grain or a vegetable depending on when it’s harvested.</h4>
<h1><center><mark>What is the difference between field corn and sweet corn?</mark></center></h1>
<h4>Field corn is harvested when the kernels are hard and is used to feed animals. 
Sweet corn is harvested with the kernels are sweet and soft, the milky stage.</h4>
<h1><center><mark>Types of corn?</mark></center></h1>
<h3><center><mark>Sweet corn</mark></center></h3>

<h2><center><mark>Sweet corn is the fresh corn we eat straight off the cob or cut from the cob. 
It's harvested during the milk stage, when the ears of corn are still young so they are not dried and the sugar hasn't turned into starch.
This is why it has such a delicious, sweet flavor.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>Sweet corn gets its name from the high sugar content. This variety comes in yellow, white, and multi-colored. 
There are many types of supersweet varieties like Silver Queen, Peaches and Cream, Honey Select, Jubilee, Butter and Suger, 
and more.</mark></center></h2>

<h3><center><mark>Dent corn</mark></center></h3>
<img src="dent corn.JPG" alt="Sweet Corn" width="300" height="400">
<h2><center><mark>Dent corn is also known as field corn. The name refers to the dent shape at the top of each kernel. 
This type of corn has a high starch content and is low in sugar which makes it not very tasty. 
Most of the corn grown in the United States is yellow dent corn.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>The majority of dent corn is dried and then used for livestock feed. 
It also can be processed and used to make food like corn syrup, corn chips, corn flakes, 
and corn tortillas.</mark></center></h2>

<h3><center><mark>Flint corn</mark></center></h3>
<img src="flint corn.JPG" alt="Sweet Corn" width="300" height="400">
<h2><center><mark>This corn variety can also be referred to as calico corn or Indian corn. Native Americans have been cultivating this corn for years.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>The name flint corn comes from the super hard shells of the corn kernels that "are as hard as flint". You can find this variety in range of colors. Because of the beautiful colors, people often use it as decorative corn during the holidays.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>Flint corn is typically grown in Central and South America and is high in nutrients. The kernels can be dried and used for things like grits, polenta, and corn meal.</mark></center></h2>

<h3><center><mark>Flour corn</mark></center></h3>
<img src="flour corn.JPG" alt="Sweet Corn" width="300" height="400">
<h2><center><mark>Soft shells and starchy kernels set flour corn apart from others. The soft starch makes these kernels easy to grind which is perfect to make corn flour.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>Flour corn is sweeter than Flint corn but not as sweet as sweet corn.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>You will find most corn flour to have a white color but it can also be found in other colors like blue.</mark></center></h2>

<h3><center><mark>Wax corn</mark></center></h3>
<img src="wax corn.JPG" alt="Sweet Corn" width="300" height="400">
<h2><center><mark>Starch content is what sets apart waxy corn from dent corn. Wax corn contains almost 100% amylopectin while regular corn contains 25% amylose and 75% amylopectin.</mark></center></h2>
<h2><center><mark>Once wax corn is processed, the corn starch works well as a stabilizer and thickener in different food products. Wax corn starch is also used in some glues that can be found on envelope backing and even on cardboard boxes.</mark></center></h2>

<h3><center><mark>Popcorn</mark></center></h3>
<img src="popcorn.JPG" alt="Sweet Corn" width="300" height="400">
<h2><center><mark>Popcorn is a popular snack to make at home or find in the movie theaters. It's actually a different type of flint corn. Popcorn kernels have a hard outer shell with a soft starchy middle.</mark></center></h3>
<h2><center><mark>When the kernels are warmed and reach the right temperature, about 212 degrees F, the outer shell coverts moisture to steam that then builds pressure and pops which creates the delicious, fluffy, edible popcorn.</mark></center></h3>
